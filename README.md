# children-game
A game i played a long time ago and cant remember the name of it. So i am recreating it from memory

### Inspirations:
I took a lot of inspiration and code from a guide on How to build a [Tetris Game](https://makeschool.org/mediabook/oa/tutorials/react-redux-tetris-app-tutorial-o4s/tetris-introduction/)

### Rules of the game:
1. You start from the top left highlighted as green corner.
2. Press on the big buttons below the grid numbered from 0 to 4. This will change all the highlighted as green to the number pressed.
3. The goal is to make the whole grid the same number.
