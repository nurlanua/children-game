# children-game
A game i played a long time ago and cant remember the name of it. So i am recreating it from memory

### Inspirations:
I took a lot of inspiration and code from a guide on How to build a [Tetris Game](https://makeschool.org/mediabook/oa/tutorials/react-redux-tetris-app-tutorial-o4s/tetris-introduction/)

### Rules of the game:
1. You start from the top left highlighted as green corner.
2. Press on the big buttons below the grid numbered from 0 to 4. This will change all the highlighted as green to the number pressed.
3. The goal is to make the whole grid the same number.

### To run the game [click here](https://nurlanua.github.io/children-game/luck-game/)

### Python version
1. Download the folder python-version
2. Open a terminal
3. Run the command below in a folder that contains luck-game.py
```
$python3 luck-game.py
```

PS: if you can't run it, probably you don't have python installed on your device
